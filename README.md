Human Minesweeper players are doomed by hesitation, guesswork, and limited
perception. Clicking in the dark and hoping for the best. Our AI-powered solver
leaves that fate behind, applying superhuman logic and perfect consistency to
every board. Where humans are doomed to fail, the AI sees certainty, turning
chaos into clean, inevitable wins.

## How does it work

Kinda poorly, I'm sure there's a much better algorithm.

It works by taking screenshots and then it uses computer vision (aka checking pixel
colors) to get the state of the board, so it only works with winmine.exe from
windows xp (may also work with windows 9x minesweeper, untested).

## Installation

You need a whatever python version and a whatever pyautogui version installed.
